## Unreleased Changes

### Added
- Placeholder for future changes

## [1.0.7] - 2025-01-31

### Added
- OpenTelemetry tracing for GitHub Actions workflows with full observability
- Dynatrace log ingestion for build logs with trace correlation
- GitHub Actions reusable actions for OTel setup and step wrapping
- Trace ID and span ID correlation between traces and logs

- Comprehensive tracing for NPM publish and version validation workflows
- Log capture and ingestion for all CI/CD steps with structured metadata
- Service name configuration as `dynatrace-mcp-server-build`
- Environment variable alignment with .env file standards (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `DYNATRACE_API_TOKEN`, `DYNATRACE_LOG_INGEST_URL`)

### Enhanced
- GitHub Actions workflows with distributed tracing capabilities
- CI/CD observability with correlated traces and logs in Dynatrace
- Build process monitoring with step-level visibility
