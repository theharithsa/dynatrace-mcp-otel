# About Dynatrace MCP Server

The Dynatrace Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is an innovative integration solution that bridges the gap between human language and Dynatrace's powerful monitoring capabilities. Built on the cutting-edge MCP standard, it enables natural language interactions with complex monitoring operations.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables seamless integration between AI assistants and external tools and services. It provides a standardized way for AI models to:

- Access real-time data from external systems
- Execute operations and commands
- Maintain context across interactions  
- Provide rich, interactive experiences

## Project Overview
