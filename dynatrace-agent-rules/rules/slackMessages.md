Absolutely! Here’s a clear and practical instruction you can give to AI (or your Copilot) to beautify Slack messages sent via webhooks. This instruction assumes you want messages to look well-formatted, readable, and engaging—with good use of Slack’s supported Markdown, emojis, sections, dividers, and maybe even interactive elements (if needed).

Instruction: Beautify Slack Webhook Messages

Objective:
Whenever sending a message to Slack via webhook, format the content to make it visually appealing and easy to read. Use Slack’s message formatting features to enhance clarity and engagement.

Formatting Guidelines: 1. Use Blocks:
Structure the message using Slack’s blocks (sections, dividers, context) instead of plain text whenever possible. 2. Highlight Key Information:
• Use _bold_ for headings or important info.
• Use _italic_ for emphasis.
• Use `inline code` for technical or code snippets. 3. Add Emojis:
Sprinkle relevant emojis to add warmth and highlight key points, but avoid overdoing it. 4. Bulleted or Numbered Lists:
For multiple items, use lists for clarity:

• Item one
• Item two
• Item three

or use Markdown 1., 2., 3. for numbered steps.

    5.	Use Dividers:

Separate sections with Slack’s divider block ({"type": "divider"}) for better visual separation. 6. Linking:
When mentioning URLs, use Slack’s format:
<https://example.com|Descriptive text>
to avoid raw links. 7. User Mentions:
When possible, mention users with <@user_id> or channels with <#channel_id>. 8. Use Context Blocks:
For small-print info (timestamps, authors, notes), use context blocks. 9. Color (Attachments):
For legacy attachments, use the color property to add a colored border (e.g., green for success, red for errors). 10. Compact Where Needed:
Avoid overly verbose messages. Summarize key points and add “Read more” links for details if necessary.

Final AI/Copilot Instruction (Copy-paste this for your Copilot):

When generating Slack messages for webhooks, always format using Slack’s Block Kit. Use sections, dividers, context, and fields to structure content. Highlight important information using bold, italics, and emojis for clarity. Use lists for multiple items, add links and mentions in Slack format, and keep messages concise but informative. Make every message visually appealing, readable, and friendly.
