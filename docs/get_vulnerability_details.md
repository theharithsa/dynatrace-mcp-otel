# Get Vulnerability Details Tool

## Overview

Retrieves detailed information about a specific security vulnerability by its security problem ID.

## Parameters

- `securityProblemId` (string, optional): The unique identifier for the security problem/vulnerability

## Best Practices for Prompts

### ✅ Good Examples

- "What's the impact of security problem XYZ?"

### ❌ Avoid These
