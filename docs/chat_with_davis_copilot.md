ü§ñ Davis CoPilot Response:

**Your Question:** "How do I troubleshoot high memory usage on my Kubernetes cluster?"

**Answer:**
To troubleshoot high memory usage in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Source**: Use the Kubernetes overview in Dynatrace to see which pods or nodes are consuming the most memory.

2. **Analyze Workload Distribution**: Check if memory usage is concentrated on specific nodes or distributed across the cluster.

3. **Review Resource Limits**: Verify that your pods have appropriate memory limits and requests configured.

4. **Monitor Memory Trends**: Look at memory usage patterns over time to identify if this is a gradual increase or sudden spike.

5. **Check for Memory Leaks**: Use Dynatrace's application monitoring to identify potential memory leaks in your applications.
